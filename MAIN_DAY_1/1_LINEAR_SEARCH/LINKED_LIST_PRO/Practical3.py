Real-World Computer Use Cases
Scenario	                        Why Linked List Helps
Music Playlist in a Music App ::	Songs can be linked together in a list. Add/remove songs without shifting all songs in memory.
Image Viewer ::	Next/previous images are linked. You can easily move forward/backward.
Undo/Redo in Word Processors ::	Each edit is a node; you can move back or forward in history.
Navigation in Browsers :::	"Back" and "Forward" pages are stored as linked nodes.
Memory Management in OS :::	Free memory blocks are linked together for quick allocation/deallocation.
Low-Level Programming :::	When you donâ€™t know the number of items in advance and need dynamic memory allocation.
