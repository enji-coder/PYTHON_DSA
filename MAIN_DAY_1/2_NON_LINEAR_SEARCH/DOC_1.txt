What is Non-Linear Search?

In DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms),

A linear search means checking elements one by one in a straight line (like searching in a list).

A non-linear search is when searching does not follow a straight line.
Instead, it uses a non-linear data structure (like trees, graphs, heaps) or a non-linear searching technique (like binary search in a sorted dataset).

 Simply: Non-linear search jumps, branches, or skips instead of going step-by-step.

 Examples of Non-Linear Search

==================================
Binary Search (on a sorted list → divide & conquer)

Search in Trees (BST search, DFS, BFS)

Search in Graphs (DFS, BFS)

Hashing (O(1) average time lookup → non-linear because it uses hash table mapping
